# damrs — implementation queue

Worked top to bottom. Each task is TDD: **write the failing test first**, then the
implementation, then `mise run check` must pass before moving on.

Rules for autonomous runs:

- Never skip the failing-test-first step. A task whose test was written after the
  code is not done; it is untested code with a test-shaped comment next to it.
- Commit per completed task, on the current branch. Never push.
- Blocked? Append to `DECISIONS.md`, take the **reversible** option, continue.
- **Stop and leave it for review** if a task turns out to touch rights
  enforcement, consent, provenance, or access control in a way the design does not
  already settle. A wrong guess there is a compliance problem, not a refactor.
- Update this file: `[ ]` → `[x]`, with a one-line note on anything surprising.

## M0 — Foundation

- [x] **0.1 Workspace skeleton.** Done. 12 members build clean; `clippy -D warnings` clean.
  *Surprise:* 17 of 31 pins had drifted, and three manifest constructs in the design
  draft were simply invalid Cargo (`[workspace.dev-dependencies]`, `optional` in
  workspace deps, undeclared `utoipa`). sqlx 0.9 split runtime/TLS features. See
  DECISIONS.md.


- [x] **0.2 `dam-core` errors + config.** Done. 24 tests; full bar green.
  *Surprise:* the failing test caught a real bug — `Secret`'s deliberately-lossy
  `Serialize` round-tripped through figment's `Serialized::defaults`, turning every
  secret default into the literal `"[REDACTED]"`. Production would have booted with
  a forgeable URL signing key and no complaint. See DECISIONS.md.
  Also landed: `Secret<T>` (redacts in Debug/Display/Serialize), domain `Error` with
  machine-readable denial reasons, `deny_unknown_fields` so typo'd keys fail startup.

- [x] **0.3 Tracing + OTel.** Done in a new `dam-telemetry` crate; 33 tests, bar green.
  *Surprise:* the child-span test proved the "tenant_id on every span" convention was
  decorative — `with_current_span` emits only the innermost span's fields, so
  everything the worker does in a child span had no tenant attribution. Needed
  `with_span_list(true)`. Also: opentelemetry 0.32 removed
  `global::shutdown_tracer_provider`, and OTLP transports are feature-gated (took
  HTTP/protobuf over gRPC to avoid tonic). See DECISIONS.md.
  All three binaries now boot through one init path; `damctl config` prints a
  resolved config with secrets redacted.

- [x] **0.4 Postgres harness.** Done, behind a `testing` feature so other crates reuse
  it from dev-dependencies. 5 tests, ~4s for 6 containers.
  *Surprise:* needed `pool_for_schema()` with connect-time `search_path` — see 0.6.

- [x] **0.5 Migration runner.** Done. 11 tests; counts asserted and matching.
  *Surprise:* sqlx 0.9 requires `AssertSqlSafe` for dynamic SQL (good — it marks every
  site needing an injection audit). Index count is 207 not 206: `_sqlx_migrations`
  has its own PK index, so the assertion excludes the ledger.

- [x] **0.6 Compliance gate suite.** Done — 16 gates, all green, D12–D15 now
  regression-protected.
  *Surprise, and the most valuable of the night:* the first run failed 10/16 and
  **three of the six passes were false** — `refused()` was `.is_err()`, so "relation
  does not exist" counted as "a constraint refused it". Caused by `SET search_path`
  on a pool affecting only one connection (exactly the §5.2 hazard). Now
  `refused_by_constraint()` asserts SQLSTATE 23/P0001 and panics on class 42.
  See DECISIONS.md.

- [x] **0.7 `TenantConn`.** Done — one constructor, and it begins a transaction. 8
  integration tests: no leak after commit or rollback, drop rolls back, cross-tenant
  read impossible, 20 concurrent writes across two tenants stay separate, missing
  schema fails at `begin`.
  *Surprise:* the dam-core length test asserted a single-char slug was valid while
  citing the regex that forbids it (`{1,38}` is a minimum of one *additional* char).
  Replaced with a cross-check that feeds 16 inputs to both the Rust validator and
  Postgres's own regex. See DECISIONS.md.

- [x] **0.8 Tenant provisioning.** Done — 7 tests green first run, plus `damctl
  migrate`/`provision-tenant`/`migrate --all` driven against the live dev stack.
  D14 verified in a real database: `face_identify enabled=false requires_dpia=true`.
  *Note:* order is schema → migrations → seed → tenant row, so a partial failure
  leaves an inert schema rather than a tenant row pointing at nothing. Idempotent
  rather than transactional. Index dir deferred to M2 with Tantivy.

- [x] **0.9 Job queue.** Done — 13 tests, incl. 10 workers × 50 jobs with no
  double-claim and no loss.
  *Surprise, and the best find of the night:* a mandatory per-tenant cap of 4 made a
  worker claim 5 of a requested 10 while 200 jobs waited — the cap starved the
  **worker**, not the greedy tenant. Fairness now comes from rank ordering alone, which
  gives fairness *and* full utilisation. Also: `SKIP LOCKED` is unavailable alongside
  window functions, so correctness rests on the UPDATE's own `state='queued'` predicate
  being re-evaluated under READ COMMITTED. See DECISIONS.md.

- [ ] **0.10 ABAC predicate compiler.** ⛔ **STOPPED FOR REVIEW — see NEEDS-REVIEW.md.**
  The mechanism is settled (one predicate, query-time, three consumers); the semantics
  are not. Five decisions determine whether an unapproved, unreleased or expired asset
  can be seen or fetched — role combination, release/expiry visibility, EULA scope,
  rule-group evaluation, and whether `all_asset_groups` bypasses expiry. Recommendations
  written; awaiting sign-off.

- [x] **0.11 CI.** Done — four parallel jobs plus a nightly AWS conformance run.
  *Surprise, and a genuine one:* `cargo deny` found **three `rustls-webpki`
  vulnerabilities** compiled into every binary. `aws-config`'s default features pull
  `legacy-rustls-ring` (rustls 0.21 / hyper-rustls 0.24) alongside the modern client, so
  the vulnerable stack was linked while never being the path we use. Fixed with explicit
  feature lists; rustls 0.21 is now absent from the graph. Also fixed a `licences`
  spelling that would have failed the job, and `publish = false` so path deps stop
  reading as wildcards. `.sqlx/` deferred — nothing uses `query!` yet. See DECISIONS.md.

## M1 — Ingest and storage

- [x] **1.1 `BlobStore` trait + conformance suite.** Done — 12 shared cases, capabilities
  declared and verified, skips reported in a `Report` rather than swallowed.
  *Note:* the storage-class skip message says outright that echoing the header back
  without changing behaviour does not count — which is exactly what SeaweedFS does.
- [x] **1.2 `S3Store` on `aws-sdk-s3`.** Done — 7 conformance cases (11 shared passes,
  2 declared skips), 5 multipart cases, 6 versioning/object-lock cases.
  *Surprises, in order of how badly they'd have bitten:*
  1. The pinned SeaweedFS tag (3.80) answers `PutBucketVersioning` with `501
     NotImplemented`. Because a version-scoped delete then fails with `AccessDenied`,
     the earlier "legal hold verified live" note was a **pass for the wrong reason**.
     Fixed by pinning 4.42 (D19) — where the hold genuinely refuses and releasing it
     genuinely permits the delete.
  2. `x-amz-bypass-governance-retention` is permission-gated. An anonymous container
     can never bypass, so the harness now declares two identities and the suite proves
     the refusal is the *permission* rather than an unimplemented header.
  3. The wait strategy matched on stdout; SeaweedFS logs to **stderr**, so it waited on
     an empty stream until timeout. Bumping the tag also cut container start 25s → 4s.
  4. `.mise.toml` exported `DAMRS_S3_*`, which match no config field — the config is
     nested and denies unknown fields, so `damd` could not have started in the dev
     environment at all. Caught by dam-core's own config tests once the full gate ran.
- [x] **1.3 `FakeS3Store`.** Done — passes the shared suite with zero skips, plus 10
  timing cases no real backend can be tested on.
  *Surprise:* my expiry test advanced to *exactly* `expires_at` and called it "just
  under". The implementation was right; the boundary is exclusive, matching S3's
  `expiry-date`, and is now pinned at t+59/t+60 — an inclusive boundary would serve one
  request more than AWS and show up only as an intermittent production 403.
- [x] **1.4 Pool + placement resolution.** Done — 15 cases, pure logic, no container.
  *Note:* "cheapest wins" is wrong stated alone. Deep Archive is the cheapest place to
  keep bytes and its per-GB retrieval can undercut Glacier IR's, so a price-only ranking
  turns ordinary downloads into restore tickets. Resolution is lexicographic:
  readable-now, then price, then a stable name tiebreak. Mutation-checked — removing the
  readability filter fails 3 tests, skipping an unknown pool fails 1.
  *Surprise:* clippy caught `40 / 1000` in my own expected value — integer division, so
  per-request charges were truncating to zero out of every estimate at the database's
  1e-8 scale (an S3 GET is 4e-7). `Rate` now works at 1e-12 with an exact ×10,000
  conversion from `numeric(12,8)`. Two pools differing only in request price would
  otherwise have compared equal.
  *Decision taken:* `enabled = false` retires a pool from new placements but keeps it
  readable — blocking reads too would turn a config change into a data outage.
- [x] **1.5 Content addressing.** Done — 9 integration cases + 3 unit, including the
  two-upload dedupe test (second upload transfers nothing, one object under the prefix)
  and a known-answer vector pinning BLAKE3 so a dependency swap cannot silently change
  every key in the estate.
  *Note:* the duplicate check compares **size as well as presence**. A key implies its
  bytes under content addressing, so a wrong-sized object at that key is corruption, not a
  cache hit — and treating it as one would make the corruption permanent, because every
  later upload of the correct bytes would also skip the write. Full digest verification
  would be stronger but costs a download per duplicate upload.
  *Note:* `Digest` normalises case at construction rather than validating at use, so an
  uppercase digest cannot produce a second key for identical content.
  *Deferred to 1.6:* a streaming upload cannot know its key before it has read the bytes,
  so the large-file path needs a staging key promoted by a server-side copy. `hash_reader`
  and `StreamHasher` are the pieces; the promotion belongs with TUS.
- [ ] **1.6 Upload.** TUS resumable + presigned direct-to-S3. Magic-byte sniffing
  via `infer` — never trust client `Content-Type`.
  *Part done:* staging-key promotion (the piece 1.5 deferred). A streamed upload lands at
  `<tenant>/staging/<upload_id>` and is promoted to its content key by a **server-side**
  copy once the digest is known, so the bytes never cross the client twice. `copy` is now a
  `BlobStore` method covered by the shared conformance suite — it was otherwise the one
  trait method the suite did not exercise, which is how the fake diverges.
  *Note:* S3 rejects `CopyObject` above 5 GiB, so promoting a §18.3 file is a multipart
  copy of ranged parts, not a rename. `copy_part_ranges` is unit-tested for contiguity at
  200 GB (40 parts, no gaps, no overlaps) and grows the part size rather than exceeding the
  10,000-part cap — a plan S3 would otherwise reject at completion, after every part copy
  had been paid for. The >5 GiB path itself only runs in the AWS nightly.
  *Note:* staging is deleted only **after** the content object exists. It is the sole copy
  of the bytes until then, so an early delete would destroy a retryable upload; an
  abandoned staging object is reaped on a timer instead — a leak that costs storage beats a
  loss that costs the upload.
  *Part done:* magic-byte sniffing (`dam-media::sniff`, 22 cases). Findings, all verified by
  probing `infer` 0.22 directly rather than assumed:
  - **`infer` does not detect ELF at all.** It carries Mach-O, PE, wasm and Java class, so a
    Linux binary fell through to `application/octet-stream` with class `Unknown` — meaning
    `is_dangerous()` was false and the upload path would have stored it happily. Explicit
    signature added.
  - An SVG **with** an XML prolog is detected as `text/xml`, so it never reached the content
    sniffer. Generic text answers are now refined — and refinement may only *specialise*: my
    first version let a catalogue XML file fall back to `text/plain`, replacing a specific
    answer with a vaguer one.
  - A shell script arrives as `text/x-shellscript` with a `Text` matcher, which a naive text
    mapping files as a document. Classed `Executable`.
  - OLE storage stays `Archive` on purpose: the same container holds legacy `.doc`/`.xls`
    **and** `.msi` installers. `Document` would point a renderer at an installer; `Executable`
    would refuse the customer's legacy Word files.
  *Part done:* the resumable-upload engine (`dam-store::resumable`, 12 integration + 3 unit).
  The constraint that shapes it: a TUS chunk may be 64 KB while S3 refuses any part under
  5 MiB except the last, so chunks accumulate into a **tail** held *in object storage* — a
  process-local buffer would make resumption sticky to one node. Mutation-checked: reversing
  the tail/chunk order fails 3 tests, removing the offset-conflict check fails 2.
  *Still to do:* the TUS HTTP surface and its `upload_sessions` table, presigned
  direct-to-S3, and the staging reaper.
- [ ] **1.7 Probe + derivatives.** libvips primary, `image` fallback. Subprocesses
  with rlimits, wall-clock, and an escape-proof temp dir.
- [ ] **1.8 Master proxy.** The §2 invariant. *Test first:* `enrichment_runs.used_original`
  is false for every run — the alarm that keeps cold storage viable.
- [ ] **1.9 C2PA.** Verify on ingest, preserve inbound manifest, re-sign
  derivatives. *Test first:* `provenance_gaps` is empty after deriving from an
  asset with credentials. **This is D13; a derivative pipeline that strips
  credentials is wrong, not incomplete.**
- [ ] **1.10 Lifecycle engine.** Dry-run default, `min_duration_until` respected,
  `pinned` honoured, `max_objects_per_run` halt.

## Frontend track (parallel, once 0.11 lands)

  *Prerequisite found in 1.2:* §6.3 tiers superseded versions on their own schedule
  (`GLACIER_IR` at 30 d), and `lifecycle_policies.only_superseded` expresses it — but
  `object_placements` is keyed `(object_key, pool_id)` with no `version_id`, so a
  noncurrent version has nowhere to record its class, minimum duration, or restore
  state. Either noncurrent tiering is delegated wholly to S3-native
  `NoncurrentVersionTransition` rules (in which case a restore of a superseded version
  has no row to hang off), or placements gain a version dimension. Decide before
  writing the engine; not decided here.

- [ ] **F.1** SvelteKit + Tailwind 4 + shadcn-svelte/bits-ui scaffold in `web/`.
- [ ] **F.2** Design tokens from the UI spec — the four-dimension state vocabulary
  (tier in form, rights in semantic colour, provenance neutral, confidence as
  bars) as components, with axe-core in CI from the first commit.
- [ ] **F.3** OpenAPI → TS client generation, wired so drift is a build error.
- [ ] **F.4** Asset grid: virtualised, keyboard-navigable, ARIA grid semantics.

## Not in scope for the overnight run

M2 onward. If M0 completes and M1 is underway, that is the night's target met —
this is ~110 engineer-weeks of work in total and no amount of autonomy compresses
that. Stop at a green `mise run check` and a clean commit rather than leaving a
half-built layer.
